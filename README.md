# IsoEngine

A flexible game engine built on MonoGame,
designed to simplify the tedious parts of game development without restricting developer freedom.

## Build Info

Currently built on `.NET Framework 4.5.2` for compatibility with `MonoGame 3.x`.

## MapTools

MapTools is an included tool for creating simple map files built from images, which IsoEngine can parse. MapTools and its map files can be used entirely independently of IsoEngine.
